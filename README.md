# HolaWin32
Win32 API object oriented, window frame and some controls, very basic.

Added a few basic controls:
Button (functional)
EditBox (functional)
ComboBox (not fully implemented)
Label (static)
ListBox (not fully implemented)
ListView (functional)

Old:
For now, only window object is added. Later on, other controls will come (static, editbox and button).
